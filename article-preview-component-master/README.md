## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS box model system (margin, padding, display method etc.). I learned what kind of situation use position and display and improved my usage. Tailwind CSS.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://devdocs.io/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand box model system. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
